# Doubly linked list
**Java** Implementation of a doubly linked list with **unit tests**.

This implementation is intended to be an exercise carried out from an academic approach.

It has been implemented for a **generic Type**.

It has been developed by performing **TDD**.

For the purpose of this exercise, several features have been implemented in order to be able to manage the list and take advantage of being doubly linked. Of course there are still many features that could be added.

####The methods supported in this implementation are:

- getSize: returns number of elements in the list.

- isEmpty: checks whether the list is empty.

- addFirst: inserts an element at the front of the list.

- addLast: inserts an element at the end of the list.

- addAtPos: inserts an element at specific position of the list.

- getLast: get the element at the end of the list.

- getFirst: get the element at the front of the list.

- getByPos: retrieve the elements at specific position of the list.

- removeFirst: remove the element at the front of the list.

- removeLast: remove the element at the end of the list.

- removeFromPos: remove the element at specific position of the list.

- toString: return full list as a string.
